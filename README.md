⭐ Login Application using JSP, Servlet, and MySQL
📋 Project Overview
This project is a simple yet complete dynamic web application that demonstrates how to build a user registration system using JSP (Java Server Pages), Servlets, and MySQL. It allows users to submit their personal details through a clean and user-friendly form, which are then stored securely in a MySQL database. This project is designed for beginners and intermediate Java web developers who want to learn how to connect a web form to a backend and perform data insertion with form validation.

🔎 Key Features
Responsive and well-styled user registration form created in index.jsp.

Client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure required fields are filled, phone numbers are exactly 10 digits, and email addresses are valid before submission.

Backend logic is handled by LoginServlet.java, which processes form data and interacts with the database.

Uses JDBC to establish a connection to a MySQL database and insert user data into the users table.

Displays a customized success page (Success.jsp) after successful registration.

Exception handling and database resource cleanup are implemented for robust and clean code execution.
